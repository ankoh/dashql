# Query Result Cache

DashQL caches successful user-query results in notebook-local files. A repeat of the same executable SQL against the same connection can load the cached Arrow result without contacting the backend. The cache is an optimization: cache lookup, eviction, and write failures do not make a query fail. Arrow IPC decode failures follow the normal query failure path and can be corrected by deleting the entry.

## Scope

The cache stores an Arrow IPC stream for a result table. It applies only when the caller opts in through `QueryExecutionArgs.cacheable`.

Notebook user queries opt in, including explicit execution, execute-on-send, agent-triggered visualization re-execution, and reruns. Shell queries never opt in: the notebook shell sets `cacheable: false`, and the standalone shell executes directly against its embedded database connection. Internal catalog, setup, and health-check queries also do not set the flag and therefore never read or write the cache. Merely loading or viewing a notebook does not execute queries or read cached results; a user-triggered execution is required.

The cache is deliberately not a general consistency mechanism. It assumes that a result is a pure function of its connection signature and executable script AST. Only scripts whose terminal statement is `SELECT`, `EXPLAIN`, or `VISUALIZE` are cacheable. `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE VIEW`, and other terminal commands always execute.

## Cache Key

Each entry is addressed by a lowercase SHA-256 digest:

```
SHA-256("dashql-query-cache-v2" + framed(stableJson(connectionParamsSignature), scriptAstSignature))
```

`createConnectionParamsSignature` produces the connector-specific signature and excludes transient connection state. Before hashing, `computeQueryResultCacheKey` recursively sorts object keys to make serialization independent of insertion order. DashQL core derives the script signature from the parser output: statement order, identifiers, literals, operators, and AST structure participate, while whitespace, comments, source offsets, and parser allocation IDs do not. All statements contribute, including commands preceding the terminal result statement. A cache hit skips the complete script.

For a terminal `VISUALIZE`, the signature includes its underlying `SELECT` but excludes the renderer and visualization specification. Result analysis and visualization projection run after cache loading, so visualization-only edits can reuse the same raw Arrow result.

Result analysis and visualization projection are not part of the key. The executor always runs post-processing after either a cache hit or a backend result, allowing the same raw Arrow table to support the relevant analysis flow.

If the executor cannot recover connection parameters or derive a signature, it treats the query as non-cacheable and executes normally. Key derivation is also best-effort and must not expose an error to the query path.

## Storage Layout

The `StorageBackend` interface owns all cache operations, so the executor does not depend on OPFS or Electron filesystem APIs.

| Backend | Cache location |
| --- | --- |
| OPFS | `notebooks/<notebook-uuid>/cache/` |
| Native | `<notebook-directory>/cache/` |

For a key `<hash>`, the cache contains:

```
cache/
  <hash>.arrow
  <hash>.arrow.last_access
```

`<hash>.arrow` is the authoritative Arrow IPC stream. Its modification time is the entry's cached-at time. `<hash>.arrow.last_access` is an empty companion file whose modification time records the most recent cache access. Native notebooks create a top-level `.gitignore` containing `cache/` when the first entry is written, but only if the user has not already created that file.

The storage interface exposes load, save, touch, list, and delete operations. `CompositeStorageBackend` routes those methods by notebook UUID to the notebook's OPFS or native backend.

Notebook archives and storage migration copy the persisted notebook metadata, schema, scripts, and draft; they do not copy cache files. Deleting an OPFS notebook removes its complete notebook directory and cache. Deleting or clearing a native notebook unregisters it but intentionally retains its user-owned directory, including the cache.

## Execution Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Execute user query] --> B{cacheable?}
    B -- no --> F[Execute connector]
    B -- yes --> C[Derive connection signature and SHA-256 key]
    C -- key unavailable --> F
    C -- key available --> D[Load hash.arrow]
    D -- hit --> E[Decode Arrow IPC and touch access marker]
    D -- miss --> F
    E --> G[Dispatch result state and run post-processing]
    F --> H[Stream connector batches into Arrow table]
    H --> G
    G --> I[Mark query succeeded]
    I --> J{backend result and cache key?}
    J -- yes --> K[Asynchronously evict and save Arrow IPC]
    J -- no --> L[Return result]
    K --> L
```

The cacheable path computes the key before query state is registered.

On a cache hit, the executor decodes the stored bytes with `arrow.tableFromIPC`, dispatches the same completed-result state used by a streamed query with empty metadata and zeroed stream metrics, then enters the shared analysis and success path. It records the cache key, cached-at timestamp, and `servedFromCache` state for the UI. A cache hit also asynchronously rewrites the empty access marker; it never rewrites the potentially large Arrow payload.

On a miss, the executor streams the backend result into an Arrow table as usual. After the query succeeds, it serializes the table with `arrow.tableToIPC(table, 'stream')` and saves it asynchronously. The caller is not blocked on the eviction scan or filesystem write. A successful save records the cache key on the finished query, while a failed save only produces a log warning.

Cancellation during an asynchronous cache read is treated like any other cancellation. Cache lookup and write failures are logged and fall back to normal execution where applicable. An Arrow IPC decode failure occurs after a hit has been selected, so it is reported as a failed query rather than falling back to the backend.

## Capacity and Eviction

Each notebook cache has independent defaults:

| Limit | Default |
| --- | ---: |
| Total Arrow payload bytes | 512 MiB |
| Arrow payload files | 200 |

Before a save, `evictToFit` lists all payload files, totals their sizes, and deletes least-recently-used entries until both the incoming result and the retained entries fit. It sorts on the `.last_access` marker modification time. If the marker is missing, the payload modification time is used, so an entry falls back to write-time ordering.

The policy counts and sizes payloads only; access markers do not count as entries. Deleting an entry removes its payload and marker. During a save-time listing, each backend also attempts to remove orphaned markers left behind by a crash or external file change.

Eviction is best-effort and non-transactional. Concurrent writers can observe approximate totals, concurrent deletion of an entry is tolerated, and an individual result larger than the byte budget may still be written after the cache is emptied. A later save will evict it if necessary.

## User Experience

For a succeeded result, the query result header shows its execution age. When the result was served from cache, that age is based on the Arrow payload's original write time rather than the latest cache access.

The **Refresh** action deletes the current query's cache entry when a key is available, then re-executes the resolved notebook query. This forces a backend result on the next execution and repopulates the entry after success. Deletion is best-effort; a failed deletion may permit the old entry to be reused.

The internals overlay includes a notebook-scoped **Query Cache** tab. It lists payload key, size, cached-at time, and last-access time; provides manual refresh of the listing; and allows individual entry deletion. The list omits `.last_access` markers.

## Limits and Correctness

- Cache identity is scoped by the connection signature and a versioned semantic AST signature, but not by a TTL, backend data version, or catalog version.
- The cache may return stale data after a backend changes. Use Refresh to invalidate a visible result, or change the SQL/signature to create a new key.
- Corrupt or incompatible Arrow bytes are not self-healed by automatic deletion. Decode errors follow the executor's normal failure path; the entry can be removed from Refresh or the cache inspector.
- A duplicate write for the same hash is safe because both writers represent the same key; last writer wins.
- The cache preserves raw results only. Analyses and projections run again after cache load.
