/// Backend-agnostic eviction policy for the file-based query result cache.
///
/// The cache stores query results as `<hash>.arrow` files in a `cache/` folder inside each session's
/// storage. Only *listing* and *deleting* those files differs between backends (OPFS reads size and
/// `lastModified` from a `File`; the native backend has to `stat()` each entry), so those primitives
/// live behind `QueryResultCacheStore` while the policy below is shared and unit-testable.
///
/// Eviction is a true LRU keyed on `lastAccessMs`. Neither OPFS nor the Tauri fs plugin exposes a
/// filesystem last-access time (nor a way to set one), and re-touching the payload on a hit would
/// mean rewriting a potentially large `.arrow` blob and would clobber its write time. So each entry
/// carries an empty sibling marker (`<hash>.arrow.last_access`) whose own mtime is bumped on every
/// hit; the backend reports that marker's mtime as `lastAccessMs`. The marker is advisory — the
/// `.arrow` files remain authoritative — so an entry with no marker falls back to its payload's write
/// time (i.e. it degrades to the old FIFO-by-creation behavior for that entry).
///
/// The cache is best-effort, not transactional: under concurrent writes the size/count totals are
/// approximate, and a delete of an already-gone file is tolerated (see `deleteCacheFile`).

/// Size/recency metadata for a single cached `.arrow` file.
