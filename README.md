FlatSQL is a flat representation of a PostgreSQL AST.
The library provides a Bison parser that materializes AST Nodes into a single compact Flatbuffer vector.
It can be compiled to WebAssembly and has been originally built for lightweight SQL instrumentation, running on every user keystroke in DashQL.

_Each AST node is packed into [24 bytes](https://github.com/ankoh/flatsql/blob/a42476e170538a4050511259763a3e4d08b989ac/proto/flatsql/program.fbs#L355-L361) and references matched substrings in the original script text.
This encoding is compact and efficient for simple passes, but is not directly suited for a full semantic analysis._
